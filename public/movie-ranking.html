<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>


<hr/>


<h3>The lord of the rings</h3>

<p>I really like this movie because it remembers me the time that I 
    spend with  my family, specially with my brothers, and also the plot is really good
    specialy on the war parts, I have to say that Aragon is the best character for me.
</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy 3</h3>

<p> The emotions of this mmovie are from other world. I have to say that the ending of
    some characters and the story for other ones are really emotive, I really liked the story of Rocket.
</p>

<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>

<p> This was the first time that I saw the heroes lose, it doesn't matter if you aren't fan of Marvel, you have to see
    this movie.
