<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Juan Daniel, I'm learning everything 
  to be a web developer, this is my first project, but I can say that html is something easy, the problems
  will come when I saw Node or something like that.
</p>

<p>I'm a student of computer science and I have the chance to enter on Angela's course,
  I have to learn a lot, but I have to give my best.
</p>

<p>I really love videogames as Smash Bros or Fifa, I also like 
  soccer and my dream it's give a legacy to my family.
